Final Project

Description:
Visualization Applet for the Graham Scan Algorithm, which allows us to find the convex hull of a set of points.

Features:
The upper frame shows the primal plane, and the lower frame shows the dual plane.
Clicking the "Show Convex Hull" button reveals the convex hull.  The upper and lower hulls are different colors.
The corresponding upper and lower envelopes of the lower and upper hulls are shown on the dual plane.

If you make points inside the convex hull, you can see that on the dual plane
the dual lines always lie between the upper and lower envelopes.

"Show Upper Hull Animation" and "Show Lower Hull Animation" show each step of the algorithm in animation.  For example, click on "Show Upper Hull Animation" once and wait until the animation finishes.
