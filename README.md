Features:
The upper frame shows the primal plane, and the lower frame shows the dual plane.
Clicking the "Start Graham Scan" button reveals the convex hull.
The corresponding upper and lower envelopes of the lower and upper hulls are shown on the dual plane.

If you make points inside the convex hull, you can see that on the dual plane
the dual lines always lie between the upper and lower envelopes.
